=================

Repository Storing Front-end Code Snippets I use personal projects.  

The snippets will Include Javascript, HTML5 boilerplate elements and Sass Mixins and or variables that I deem useful. This Repository will eventually become a place to store my own personal front-end framework with various UI components that I've developed over the years. So far, the repo includes:

##JavaScript
* CSS Background Slideshow
* Smooth Scroll Snippets

##CSS
* Normalize CSS
* Fork of HTML5 boilerplate global Styles

##HTML5
* HTML5 boiler plate fork Template (with added customizations)
